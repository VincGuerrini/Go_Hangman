# **The HangMan** 

**Hangman** is a word-guessing game where the goal is to guess a secret word, one letter at a time.
Each time the player guesses a wrong letter, a part of the hangman drawing is added.

The player **wins** if they guess all the letters before the drawing is complete, and **loses** if the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
